    <h3 style="color:dimgray;background-color: pink;"> NJIT 31573054 Bachelor's of Architecture </h3>
    <p style="color:lightslategrey"> I am a first year student pursuing a degree in architecture. I was raised in Perth Amboy, NJ. The reason I chose to study architecture is because at a very young age I use to design houses on Minecraft which started my intrest in the feild. Growing up I also saw my grandpa build houses around the small area we lived in at my native country. <br> I would consider myself a very cheery and dedicated person. I love to do community service and some of my hobbies are painting, going on walks and watching netflix. I am very excited for my studies at NJIT and what the future has to store.</p>
