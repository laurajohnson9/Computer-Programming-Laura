    <p style="color:rgb(248, 183, 205);">Born October 10th I grew up in a small town full of lovely people.
        <br>
        My creative mind started to develop at a young age likely due to the infulnce of my small town as it valued creativity and the arts. As I grew I gained a bigger apprection for all the art around me. I espcally took a liking to the art that was around me every day, architecture. Now I study the subject that I apprected as a child and now appercate even more as an adult. I as continue my studies I learn more and more and continue to grow.
