    Student Tips:
</h4>
<p style="color: black;" class="p1" id="p1">
1. The best way to get to your classes on time is by taking the trains or busses before your planned arrival time so if any inconvenience with public transport, you will be still on time to class.<br>
2. It is better to use the Rutgers Bus from Newark Penn Station just to save yourself the light rail fare.<br>
3. Make sure to pay attention to any changes to your source of transportation, and if their times have been delayed.<br>
4. In the first week of classes, try to figure out a system that works best so you can get to your classes on time and don't have a stressful trip to campus.
