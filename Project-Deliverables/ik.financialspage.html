    1. Don't stress and always remember there are many solutions! <br>
    2. Apply for financial aid early. Financial aid is required for everyone and it can be tedious but just take it slow and dont rush it. Tip: Get it done before you even apply so you can get  it out of the way. You can find the link to apply below: <li><a class="FAFSA" href="https://studentaid.gov/">FAFSA</a></li> <br>
    3. Financial deadlines are important. The link below provides you will all the crucial deadlines for the 2023-2024 semester (dates will change and be updated each year). <li><a class="NJIT Deadlines" href="https://www.njit.edu/financialaid/dates-and-deadlines#:~:text=1%20April%2015%2C%202023%3A%C2%A0FAFSA%20filing%20deadline%20%28New%20Jersey,renewal%20and%20first-time%C2%A0applicants%C2%A0for%20Spring%20term%20only%29%20More%20items">NJIT Deadlines</a></li> <br>
    4. When you become a student you will be able to access all your financial information through your highlander pipeline under "Bursar". <br>
    5. GRANTS: Always remember and to take advantage of any grant options you might come across in before college and during since those you do not have to pay back. <br>
    6. LOANS: You can get access to loans in many ways. The most efficent way is through federal or private loans which can all be figured out on your FAFSA account (same link from line 2). <br> 
    7. SCHOLARSHIPS: Scholarships are the best way to cut down on tuiton costs. Merit scholarships which are given when accepted to the school college, are the most common ways to recieve scholarships however, if you feel like you were not given enough you can do a scholrship appeal (link below). Tip: NJIT is very generous when it comes to the appeals so do not hestitate to fill out the form write a very thorough detailed explanation on why you think you should get more scholarship. There are also many outside scholarships you will come across that you can apply to, most of them are competitions which require essays or some sort of work but, it is okay always try since you got nothing to lose. Below is a link for outside scholarships. <li><a class="Scholarship Appeal" href="https://www.njit.edu/financialaid/healthservices/financialaid/scholarship-appeal-form-2023-2024">Scholarship Appeal</a></li> <li><a class="Outside Scholarships" href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/scholarship-search?ef_id=98b27ecdfaf2100a247e1b90a3a56b1a:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4330!10!73873702037450!73873653332659&msclkid=98b27ecdfaf2100a247e1b90a3a56b1a">Outside Scholarships</a> </a></li><br>
    8. Lastly, keep in mind that college is not only expensive because of its tuition but also because of other immenities. So, keep in mind things like, books and supplies, parking permit, housing, food, etc.
