    The Process of Application to NJIT
    </h2>
    <p style="color: black;" class="p1" id="p1">
        The steps to apply to NJIT are relatively simple. The university is connected to the Common Application which means, the first step is to create your Common App account. The next step is to select the New Jersey Institute of Technology as one of your schools. It is required to complete the questionnaire, submit letters of recommendation, and high school transcripts. When applying to the Hillier College of Art and Design, it is important to meet the portfolio requirements. NJIT is a test optional university so SAT and ACT scores are not required but can be submitted if preferred. Lastly, the final step is pay the application fee.

        Student Tips:
    </h4>
    <p style="color: black;" class="p1" id="p1">
        1. Since the NJIT Application is not very difficult, we suggest you start the process early and aim towards the the early admissions deadline so your decesion can be released early; leaving you more time to think about which school you want to attend. <br> 2. If you are looking to go into the architecture and design school, make sure to have your portfolio ready months before so you can feel confident about the work you are submitting to admissions. <br> 3. Do not overthink the questions on the application! Being yourself can get you farther than trying to write something that is not true to you. <br> 4. Remember to list all your extracurriculars since it does look good on your application!
